You will receive:
- User's report of the situation
- Data from 5 intelligence sources (weather, maps, news, social media, resources)

Your response MUST be a simple JSON with your decision:

  "is_emergency": true or false,
  "emergency_type": "fire" or "hurricane" or "flood" or "none",
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "reasoning": "One sentence explanation"

Decision criteria:
- TRUE EMERGENCY: Official alerts, emergency vehicles responding, evacuation orders, dangerous conditions confirmed by multiple sources
- FALSE ALARM: No official reports, normal conditions, conflicting evidence, routine activities (drills, BBQ, construction)

Be decisive. Lives depend on quick assessment."""

2. Each step must have valid GPS coordinates (use the map data provided)
3. Coordinates should show logical progression from start to safe zone
4. Step 1 coordinates = current location
5. Step 5 coordinates = safe shelter location
6. Steps 2-4 should be waypoints along the evacuation route
7. Each step should have realistic distance and time estimates
8. Include specific warnings for dangerous areas
9. The evacuation route must avoid fire/hazard zones
10. Total evacuation distance should be realistic (500-1500 meters)

Be direct, clear, and authoritative. Lives depend on this information."""

2. Are there any official emergency reports?
3. What is the volume and sentiment of social media posts?
4. Are emergency services actively responding?
5. Is there evidence of an actual emergency?

If the evidence suggests this is a false alarm (e.g., routine fire drill, scheduled test, no corroborating reports), provide a calm, professional assessment with helpful suggested actions.

EVACUATION PLANNING TASK:

Based on the above data, you must create a detailed 5-step evacuation plan.

- Current Location: {maps_data.get('current_location', {}).get('coordinates', {})}
- Fire/Hazard Zone: {maps_data.get('fire_location', maps_data.get('storm_center', {})).get('coordinates', {})}
- Safe Shelter: {maps_data.get('safe_zones', [{}])[0].get('coordinates', {}) if maps_data.get('safe_zones') else {}}
- Waypoints: {maps_data.get('evacuation_routes', [{}])[0].get('waypoints', []) if maps_data.get('evacuation_routes') else []}

EVACUATION ROUTE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Step 1: Start at current location (library)
2. Steps 2-4: Follow the waypoints provided in the map data
3. Step 5: Arrive at the safe shelter
4. Each step must include specific directions (e.g., "Exit building", "Head north on X street", "Turn left onto Y street")
5. Include distance and time for each step
6. Note any blocked roads from the map data
7. Include specific warnings for each step based on the hazards present

Consider the emergency type ({emergency_type}) when writing warnings and instructions.
